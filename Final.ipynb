    "# Healthy Plate Builder\n",
    "\n",
    "Our BILD 62 final project aims to promote healthier, yet tasty, eating habits. The USA has many unhealthy food options and has oversaturated our daily meals with fast and overprocessed foods. Those options are not nutritional and beneficial for a balanced diet, so using our program would help guide people in a better direction regarding choosing what to eat. It creates interactive solutions to promote a better and mindful diet.\n",

    "## About this project\n",
    "By utilizing data from the USDA food database we would like to offer an interactive plate builder where users can build their plate with a selection of foods that are nutritious (fruits, veggies, protein, dairy, carbohydrates). Once a user has finished building their plate we hope to provide a nutrional analysis of the plate with details on balanced the meal is and suggestions for meal improvements."
